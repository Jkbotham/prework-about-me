      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I had a dream job and after working in the market I realized it sounded a lot better than it actually was in practice.  At this point I would like to find a job that I dont dread going to everyday and allows me to spend more time traveling.</p>

      <p>Minneapolis, MN</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always had an interest in working with computers and solving problems on them.  After many interviews I've come to find a lot of what computer developers do is finding errors in code to make things work.  That sounds like it would be my ideal job, to make things work and solve problems big and small.</p>
